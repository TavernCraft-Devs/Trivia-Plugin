# Trivia-Plugin

Trivia! plugin is a way to bring fun to any server's chat. In trivia, there are a total of 10 rounds by default. There
will be a question asked in the beginning of the round; the first player to answer that question correctly will win that
round. The person to win the most amount of rounds by the end will win the trivia event. Their name will be announced in
chat, and they can receieve a customized reward that admins can configure beforehand. These rewards can include items (
with names, lores, enchants), money, exp, or a chat message.

New questions/answers can be added from an in-game GUI menu (opened with /trivia), and the rewards can be configured
from here too. Questions/answers may also be removed or modified from the menu.

Server admins can import questions form a predefined list by using /trivia import <id>, which will automatically add
that question, answer, and author of that question to the plugin's files.

/trivia help contains more details on all the other commands and their usages.
