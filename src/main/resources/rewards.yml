# - Info --------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file stores the rewards for trivia winners for places 1, 2, and 3.
# You can change these rewards from in-game (recommended) or here.
# The only setting you can ONLY change from here and not in-game, is 'Commands'
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# You can write your own commands below the 'Commands' section and that command will
# be ran by the server console when a player wins the game.
# You may like this feature if your server has a points or crates plugin and you'd
# like to give winners stuff from those plugins!
# The placeholders for commands are shown below.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Placeholders:
#   %player% for player name,
#   %username% for user's name.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example: to send a player a message when they win (from essentials), it would look like this:
# Commands:
#   - 'msg %username% Congratulations! You won!'
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
